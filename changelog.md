## 1.1.1 - 2018-10-21

**Whats new?**

* `@marblejs/core` resolves [\#67](https://github.com/marblejs/marble/issues/67) \(path matching for trailing slash combined with wildcard parameter\)

## 1.1.0 - 2018-09-29

10 days ago we've got an official v1.0.0 release - this time we have another cool news to share with you!

**Whats new?**

* Introducing new package `@marblejs/middleware-jwt` - a HTTP requests authentication middleware based on [JWT](https://jwt.io) mechanism. ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰ For more API reference please visit our official [documentation](https://marblejs.gitbook.io/marble/available-middlewares/authorizeusd).
* Resolved an issue in the scenario when the grouped middleware throws an error \(eg. when request is not authorized\) and connected _Effect_ endpoint unexpectedly catches the thrown error. See more details please visit \#73 
* Support for TypeScript `v3.1.x`
* _\[internal\]_ - Moved back from `webpack` to well-tested `tsc` compiler which makes our build artifacts more predictable and less error prone

## 1.0.0 - 2018-09-18

![We made it! &#x1F680; ](.gitbook/assets/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e67697068792e636f6d2f6d656469612f336f366f7a6f6d6a7763514a70647a3570362f67697068792e676966.gif)

## 1.0.0-rc.3 - 2018-09-17

**Whats new?**

* Integration with [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) library
* Support for wildcard parameter, eg. `/foo/:param*`. For more details see: [example implementation](https://github.com/marblejs/marble/blob/master/packages/%40integration/src/controllers/static.controller.ts)

```typescript
const getFile$ = EffectFactory
  .matchPath('/:dir*')
  .matchType('GET')
  .use(req$ => req$
    .pipe(
      map(req => req.params.dir as string),
      switchMap(readFile(STATIC_PATH)),
      map(body => ({ body }))
    ));
```

* Fixed a problem with incorrectly generated declaration files for `@marblejs/middleware-joi` package.

## 1.0.0-rc.2 - 2018-09-10

`pre-release`

**Whats new?**

* Fixed problem with incorrectly concatenated wildcard endpoint when combined with parametrized route.

```typescript
const notFound$ = EffectFactory
  .matchPath('*')
  .matchType('*')
  .use(req$ => req$.pipe(
    switchMap(() =>
      throwError(new HttpError('Route not found', HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND))
    )
  ));

export const api$ = combineRoutes(
  '/api/:version',
  [ notFound$ ],
);
```

* For non-TypeScript developers there was no validation made during app startup, eg. `EffectFactory` methods were not validated if developer provided wrong HTTP method to the `matchType`. Going to the expectations we introduced dedicated `CoreError` type used for throwing an package related error messages, eg. for notifying non-TypeScript developers if they made a mistake in the method arguments.

* TypeScript v.3.0.x support
* RxJS v6.2.2 support
* Lerna v3.3.0 support
* Introduced Webpack based build process - from now builds are optimized and properly compressed

## 1.0.0-rc.1 - 2018-08-14

`pre-release`

**Breaking changes:**

* Changed `httpListener` error handler attribute from `errorMiddleware` ðŸ‘‰ `errorEffect`. There was an inconsistency with previous error handler definition and naming. We had to correct this because error handler acts as an _Effect_ instead of _Middleware_.

_Old bootstrapping API:_

```typescript
const app = httpListener({
  middlewares,
  effects,
  errorMiddleware,  ðŸ‘ˆ
});
```

_New bootstrapping API:_

```typescript
const app = httpListener({
  middlewares,
  effects,
  errorEffect,  ðŸ‘ˆ
});
```

**Whats new?**

* Exposed `res.send` method - from now you don't have to send response manually via dedicated Node.js `http.OutgoingMessage` API. The `res.send` method returns an empty stream, thus it can be easily composed inside middleware pipeline.

```typescript
const middleware$: Middleware = (req$, res) =>
  req$.pipe(
    switchMap(() => res.send({ body: ðŸ’©, status: 304, headers: /* ... */ }),
  );
```

* Exposed type aliases for common Marble.js architectural blocks:

```typescript
const effect$: Effect = req$ =>
  req$.pipe(
    // ...
  );

const middleware$: Middleware = (req$, res) =>
  req$.pipe(
    // ...
  );

const error$: ErrorEffect = (req$, res, err) =>
  req$.pipe(
    // ...
  );
```

## 1.0.0-rc.0 - 2018-07-07

`pre-release`

**Breaking changes**

* In order to factorize the routing table statically, we need to introduce the breaking change in **Effect** API definition. 

_Old Effect API:_

```typescript
const getUsers$: Effect = request$ =>
  request$.pipe(
    matchPath('/'),
    matchType('GET'),
    // ...
  );
```

_New Effect API:_

```typescript
const getUsers$ = EffectFactory
  .matchPath('/')
  .matchType('GET')
  .use(req$ => req$.pipe(
    // ...
  ));
```

* separately imported `matchPath` and `matchType` stream operators are removed and are part of `EffectFactory` instead.

**Whats new?**

* `@marblejs/core` - **internals** - refactored + rebuilt routing resolving mechanism. Thanks to the latest changes we gained **hudge** performance boost.
* `@marblejs/core` - **internals** - improved performance for middleware resolving flow
* `@marblejs/core` - **internals** - rewritten URL params intercepting mechanism
* `@marblejs/middleware-body` - added support for _x-www-form-urlencoded_ Content-Type
